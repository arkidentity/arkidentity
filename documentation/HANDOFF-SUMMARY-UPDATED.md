# ARK Identity Website - Executive Summary (UPDATED)
**Ready for Claude Code Build**  
**Date:** January 18, 2025

---

## What We Built Today

**Problem:** ARK Identity had content scattered across Mighty Networks, Square Online, and unclear brand positioning.

**Solution:** Unified brand strategy and complete website content structure for arkidentity.com

---

## Core Brand Identity (LOCKED IN)

**Mission Statement:**  
"We help believers experience God daily and churches multiply disciples naturally."

**Homepage Headline:**  
"Discipleship Tools That Naturally Multiply"

**Three-Fold Mission:**
1. Know God and our identity in Christ (Spiritual Formation)
2. Share the Gospel with the next generation (Evangelism + Campus)
3. Make disciples who multiply (DNA System)

---

## The ARK Ecosystem (4 Properties)

1. **arkidentity.com** - Brand hub/landing page (THIS BUILD)
2. **app.arkidentity.com** - Daily tools for individuals (LIVE)
3. **dna.arkidentity.com** - Church multiplication system (LIVE)
4. **campus.arkidentity.com** - Campus ministry model (PROOF OF CONCEPT - build later)

---

## What arkidentity.com Does

**Purpose:** Direct audiences to two main products (app + DNA) with campus as emerging third pillar

**Homepage Structure:**
- **Two main CTAs:** "For Individuals" (app) + "For Churches" (DNA)
- **Campus callout below:** Smaller section positioning it as proof of concept at U of Iowa

**Why this matters:**
- Honest about current state (app + DNA are live products, campus is emerging)
- Doesn't dilute focus from revenue/impact drivers
- Sets expectation that campus will scale later (Vision 2026 Goal #1)

---

## Site Structure (6 Pages)

1. **Home** - Hero (2 main CTAs), 2 product cards, campus callout, mission, Vision 2026 link
2. **About** - Mission, origin story, how we do it, pillars
3. **Team** - Leadership (Travis + Kimberly), Advisory Board (4 placeholders), Volunteer Leaders (13 people)
4. **What We Believe** - Core beliefs, PDF download
5. **Get Involved** - Giving (2 options), Careers (2 openings), Partner with Us
6. **Vision 2026** - Goals, testimonial, team grid (2 full-time + 13 volunteers), donor CTAs

---

## Key Decisions Made

### ✅ Homepage Structure
- **Two main CTAs:** "For Individuals" (app) + "For Churches" (DNA)
- **Campus positioned as:** Proof of concept callout below main cards
- **Rationale:** Campus ministry is real but emerging, not equal to app/DNA yet

### ✅ Team Page Structure
**Section 1:** Leadership (Travis + Kimberly with photos)  
**Section 2:** Advisory Board (4 people - names/titles only, no photos)  
**Section 3:** Volunteer Leaders (13 people - simple list with locations)

**Why this works:**
- Shows you're not a lone ranger (advisory board adds credibility)
- Transparent about volunteer model (13 leaders making disciples while working full-time)
- Scalable (can add more volunteers without redesigning page)

### ✅ Vision 2026 Team Grid
**Headline:** "2 Full-Time Leaders. 13 Volunteers. Imagine 100."

**Layout:**
- **Top row (highlighted):** Travis + Kimberly (labeled "Full-Time")
- **Grid below:** 13 volunteer leaders (labeled "Volunteer Leader" + location)

**Why this works:**
- Tells compelling donor story (look what volunteers did, imagine full-time coordinators)
- Honest about capacity (2 full-time staff, not 15)
- Makes "hire 2 campus coordinators" make sense

### ✅ Mission Statement
"We help believers experience God daily and churches multiply disciples naturally."

### ✅ Vision 2026 Goals (Realistic)
- **Goal 1:** Launch U of Iowa campus ministry (30-50 students, hire 2 coordinators)
- **Goal 2:** Scale app + DNA (1K daily users, 100+ completing 100-day streaks, 3 church partnerships)
- **Goal 3:** Expand products (DNA Manual, Halloween Guide, Marriage Course, ARK Journal, 1 global mission, 2-3 Bridge missions)

### ✅ Origin Story (Linear)
- 2013-2019: Created in Las Vegas, refined curriculum
- 2020-2024: COVID pivot to Zoom, 1000+ students trained
- 2025-Present: Built app, DNA system, launched campus ministry as proof of concept

### ❌ What We REMOVED
- "3D Framework" as overarching brand language (only applies to journal tool)
- "Formational Trainings" / "ARK Trainers" (outdated model)
- "In-person workshops" as core offering
- Campus ministry as equal third CTA on homepage (repositioned as proof of concept)
- Overpromising on Vision 2026 (was 5K users, 100+ trainers, 5 missions—now realistic)

4. **Launch:** Test all CTAs, embeds, mobile responsiveness
5. **Announce:** Email supporters, update social bios

---

## Critical Reminders for Claude Code

- **Two main CTAs on homepage:** "For Individuals" (app) + "For Churches" (DNA) — equal prominence
- **Campus ministry:** Smaller callout below main cards, positioned as "proof of concept"
- **No 3D Framework language** except when specifically describing 3D Journal tool
- **Team page has 3 sections:** Leadership (photos) + Advisory Board (names only) + Volunteer Leaders (list)
- **Vision 2026 team grid:** 2 full-time (highlighted) + 13 volunteers (with "Volunteer Leader" labels)
- **Giving page:** TWO embedded options (Square + Global Service Associates)
- **Vision 2026 goals:** Realistic and achievable (not aspirational fluff)

---

## The Positioning Story (For Donors)

**Current State:**
- 2 full-time leaders (Travis + Kimberly)
- 13 volunteer leaders (making disciples across multiple states while working full-time jobs)
- 2 live products (app for individuals + DNA for churches)
- 1 proof-of-concept campus ministry (U of Iowa)

**Vision 2026:**
- Add 2 full-time campus coordinators
- Scale app to 1K daily users
- Partner with 3 churches for full DNA implementation
- Launch new resources (DNA Manual, courses, ARK Journal)

**The Ask:**
"Look what volunteers accomplished. Imagine what full-time staff could do. Help us hire 2 campus coordinators and multiply this model nationwide."
