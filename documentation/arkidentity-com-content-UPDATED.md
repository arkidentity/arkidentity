### The Origin Story

#### 2013-2019: The Beginning
Travis Gluckler created ARK Identity in 2013 as God walked him through his own journey of identity in Christ. He developed teachings and activation tools to equip a group of disciples in Las Vegas. Over the years, he refined the curriculum multiple times, renaming the original courses from "ARK 101" and "ARK 102" to "Identity Through The Trinity" and "Freedom." Many courses followed, building a comprehensive library of discipleship resources.

#### 2020-2024: The Pivot
In January 2020, ARK was ready to launch in-person trainings at Encounter Church Las Vegas. Little did Travis know that God had a different plan. The week of the first session was the same week COVID quarantine hit America, and The ARK went LIVE on Zoom instead. What seemed like a huge transition turned out to be a tremendous blessing. Since going online in 2020, ARK hosted trainings for over 1000 students across multiple states.

Although Zoom trainings proved effective, ARK began focusing on in-person weekend workshops where people could experience the gospel in immersive environments.

#### 2025-Present: The Product Shift
ARK realized people needed daily activation tools, not just weekly lessons or occasional workshops. We built an app with Scripture journaling, guided prayer, theology education, and discipleship courses. We developed the DNA Groups system for churches to multiply disciples naturally. And we launched campus ministry at the University of Iowa as a proof-of-concept model for reaching and discipling students.

**Today, ARK provides resources for individuals, systems for churches, and a campus model being tested—all designed to activate disciples who multiply.**

---

### Pillars of ARK

Our discipleship philosophy rests on three pillars:

1. **To personally hear God's voice through His word and Spirit**
2. **To know our true identity through experiencing the Trinity**
3. **To be disciples who make disciples**

---

### Consider the Impact

**What does ARK Identity look like with:**
- 100 ARK-equipped churches around the country?
- 1000 DNA Groups multiplying disciples naturally?
- Campus ministries on 50 universities using our model?

**This is the power of exponential growth in the Body of Christ—shifting entire cultures from consumers to producers.**

## Page 4: WHAT WE BELIEVE

### Opening Statement

The ARK Identity Training believes that theology should be rooted in the Bible, especially the New Testament. We see a reliable theology articulated by Irenaeus, Athanasius, Gregory Nazianzus, and more recently, Karl Barth, Thomas F. Torrance, and many others. This theology is often referred to as **Trinitarian Theology** due to its emphasis on the relational nature of the **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.**

### Core Beliefs

- The Father, Son, and Spirit are one God, united in love for one another.

- Jesus Christ, as the Word made flesh, is fully God and fully human.

- Jesus accurately reveals the goodness and love of God, and reveals humanity as God intended us to be.

- As our Creator, Jesus represented all humanity, and all people benefit from his vicarious humanity: his life, death, resurrection and ascension. Jesus Christ atoned for all sin and suffered its full consequence.

- God has in Christ reconciled all humanity to himself through his son, Jesus (Colossians 1:20). (However, universal atonement should not be equated with universalism.)

- The judgment of God against evil has been executed in Jesus Christ so that all might repent and receive forgiveness and, through the Holy Spirit, share in Christ's resurrected, eternal life.

- People are exhorted to respond to this reconciliation and participate in the life we were all created for.

- Jesus, as the intersection of divinity and humanity, has made it possible for humanity to share in the life and love of the Trinity, fulfilling God's eternal intention.
